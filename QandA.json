And it has an even trickier answer.\n\nAlright, so when you're applying Signature Technique, it'd just read Hidden Power as being a Burst 1.\n\nSo you can apply any of Scattershot, Shock and Awe, Vicious Storm, Alternative Energy, or Bloodied Speed. \n\nAll of those continue to apply even if you choose to take advantage of Words of Power, and use Hidden Power with an alternate range.\n\nAlternative Energy is pretty much a waste since you can already do this with Letter Press.\n\nScattershot simply replaces Hidden Power's base range, removing Burst 1 as an option, but you can still opt to use Words of Power's other options. Still, not a great interaction as it's a range-replacement and Words of Power already does that better for you. Although 3-targets at 4m range MAY be good enough to warrant it, as unlike AOE attacks, it doesn't run the risk of hitting your allies.\n\nShock and Awe, Vicious Storm, Bloodied Speed all continue to apply all the time however! So for example, even if you use  a Hidden Power Vicious Storm as a Ranged 6, 1-Target, it still gains Smite.\n\nSo in short, your options are limited by Hidden Power's default range. And no, you cannot apply multiple Signature Technique modifications to the same Pokemon. But several of the options you can apply always apply, regardless of the actual range at which you use the Move."

You could make your Struggle Attacks with either the Rapier, which would just give you a flat +1 DB bonus, or with the Pistol, which would simply make your Struggle Attack have a 4 meter range but with a -2 Accuracy Penalty for being in your Off-Hand slot. Let's say the Rapier grants the Moves Cheap Shot and Riposte. You can use those as normal. Let's say the Pistol grants Bullseye and Bleed!. Due to the clause about Off-Hand slot weapons, Bullseye would take a -2 Accuracy Penalty, and you could not use Bleed!. \n\nOf course, you could wield similar weapons when dual wielding too, such as a pair of daggers that collectively grant you Double Swipe, Furious Strikes, and Pierce!

The user gains a +1 Accuracy Bonus to Bone Club, Bonemerang, and Bone Rush.  Additionally, the user cannot be disarmed, or have their Thick Club forcefully removed by Trick, Switcheroo, Thief, or any other Moves or effects unless the user wishes it.\n</quote>\n\n<quote>\nMove: Fling\nType: Dark\nFrequency: Scene x2\nAC: 2\nDamage Base X: See Effect\nClass: Physical\nRange: 6, 1 Target, Fling\nEffect: The user throws a held item, determining the\neffect of Fling.\nContest Type: Tough\nContest Effect: Catching Up\n</quote>\n\nSo my player is interpreting \"unless the user wishes it\" to mean the cubone can Fling a Thick Club without being disarmed. The logic is that cubone has other moves like Bonemerang that represent throwing the bone club and it returning, so Fling + Bone Wielder would make the Thick Club work the same way.\n\nMy interpretation is that the use of Fling throws the item, meaning \"the user wishes it\" to be thrown. The Move doesn't force the user to lose the item, because it's a choice to activate that. If you don't want to lose the Thick Club, don't Fling it. This has been my ruling so far, though we're far too early in the game for it to have come up in action yet. Just talking build theory for the future. I don't particularly want to step on my player's ideas, but I also don't particularly think it follows the wording or intention of the rules.\n\nApparently it's common to build a Cubone with Bone Wielder and a Thick Club explicitly to use Fling without losing the thrown item. Is this setup possible? Is there a point to it besides type coverage? (The net result is that both Fling and Bonemerang become AC2, DB7, Range 6 moves, but Bonemerang is Ground with Double Strike and Fling is Dark with no other perks. I don't see the advantage.)"

Interrupt actions act with Advanced Priority (meaning you can use up actions from a future turn too), which makes how this combination works out slightly complicated.\n\nBasically, you need to have two Standard Actions available within both this round and the next round, or you can't do it. If you've already used your Standard Action (so, if you are faster than the pokemon attacking your friend, you already used your Standard Action with a different Priority/Interrupt move, or it delayed until after your turn) then you are out of luck and will just need to take the hit.\n\nIf you have already acted this round, and Intercept, then you are using your Shift and Standard Actions for your <em>next</em> turn as well, in the next round. This leaves you with no actions free to use Protect (you have a Swift Action, but Protect requires a Standard Action). Next round, you won't be able to do anything on your turn except for use a Swift Action.\nIf you have <em>not</em> already acted this round, and Intercept, then you are using up <em>this</em> round's Shift and Standard Actions, and can then also expend your Standard Action for your next round to use Protect. You will then get your turn this round as normal when your initiative is reached, but you will not be able to do anything except use a Swift Action. Next round, you will not have a Standard Action available with which to use moves, so can only Shift and use another Swift Action.\n\nI hope that's easy enough to understand!",

If something with Overland 2 (possibly due to Slowed or negative Speed combat stages) declares a Pass move, can they still move 4 meters in a straight line? What about if you declare a Pass move after using up most or all of your movement?\n\nI've generally assumed that you need to have the movement capability to spare, and the Pass keyword only mentions '4 meters' to limit how much you could spend rather than giving that much movement on spending the action; even with Overland 8 you can only move 4 meters with a Pass move to hit at most three lined up targets, though of course you could move up to 4 meters beforehand to set up without limiting your Pass movement. The interpretation where you may move up to 4 meters even if you previously couldn't have moved that far would otherwise have silly implications, like a Pass move being more efficient at crossing long distances than the Sprint action for Overland 7 or lower.\nJust a little confused as to how the Move's Shifting movement dash actually lets you shift during the Pass Move as opposed to moving during the Shift."

Long and Short range weapons don't have that requirement and so cannot be used as weapons with PK combat (though you could rule a throwing knife as an Improvised Weapon with PK Combat I'd you so desired).\n\n<strong>Q248:</strong> Strictly speaking, PK Combat does not move any items, it merely increases the range of your attack. The fluff is clearly of the weapon leaving your hand and returning but for all crunch purposes, it remains always wielded within your square (so, returns to you after it hits). \nTelekinetic itself only allows you to essentially used your Focus as your Power capability at range, chiefly applied out of combat.

            "Q. 273:   Another thread got me thinking about Double Strike and after several read-throughs of the brief paragraph describing it, I am more confused than ever. I'd really love it if someone could clear it up for me and I'd love it even more if the wording was altered in a future revision to make the whole thing a lot more clear.\n\nThis is how I understand it to work but I am only about 60% confident that my understanding is even remotely close to the truth: basically, I believe that if both attacks hit, the damage base is doubled. For instance with respect to the DB 3 Double Kick, if both hit then Double Kick would become a single DB 6 attack. On a critical hit, the DB is taken prior to the doubling of the DB so each crit would add a DB of the value of DB 3 so if both attacks were crits, the damage would effectively be: DB6 + 2*DB3. If the attack received STAB bonuses, the critical hits both receive STAB bonuses as per the example but what about the non-critical damage? Is STAB added prior to or after the doubling? I have no idea if the STAB inclusive formula for a double crit is DB8 + 2*DB5 or DB10 +2*DB5... The fact that the example states that it is using the DB prior to it being doubled (Which the example uses DB 5) suggests that it is the latter. However Double Strike turning a DB 3 attack with STAB into a DB 10 attack sure doesn't feel right...\n\nI don't know... I think I have the right understanding but really, someone confirming one way or the other would really help me out.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I have noticed that the Double Strike keyword doesn't actually say \"Damage Base\" it says \"Damage Base value\" it is possible that all of the above is wrong and Damage Base value isn't supposed to mean \"Damage Base\" but \"Actual Damage\". If that is the case, then it is a whole lot more straight forward but I'd really love it that if that is the intention, the term was changed to \"Actual Damage\" as that is the term used to represent that value in the Dealing Damage section of the book. Or better yet, just write that Double Attack attacks and damages twice but only applies the stats and additional modifiers of both the attacker and defender once regardless of the number of hits. It reads much simpler.",

Silly question, but I might as well ask.\n\nQ312: Are there size/weight bonuses and penalties to the various Combat Maneuvers? I haven't been able to find them in the Core book yet, but something in Bug Ace (under their first Feature, Insectoid Utility) makes me believe they're somewhere:\n\n\"Threaded: Your Poke&#204;&#129;mon may use its Threaded attack to perform the Trip, Grapple, Push and Disarm Combat Maneuvers and ignores Weight and Size restrictions when doing so.\"\n\n<del>Q313: Does Dominance in Grapples retrigger at the beginning of the Dominant Trainer/Pok&#195;&#169;mon's turn?

The Substitute is immune to Status\nAfflictions and Status Moves. Moves with the Social\nor Sonic keywords completely ignore and bypass the\nSubstitute. Once the Substitute has been destroyed, the\nuser may be hit as normal. Substitute cannot be used if\nthe user has less than 1/4 of their full Hit Points.\n</quote>\n\nTo my reading, it's pretty clear that the wording of Substitute is talking about Moves target the user. Something that has a \"hit\" or \"not hit\" check condition.... which is not synonymous with \"Accuracy Check\", by the way. Because, for example, Substitute would stop something like Pain Split, which does not have an Accuracy Check, but must target a foe and \"hit\" successfully. Self-Range Status Moves don't even have a \"Target\" line; they have a RANGE of Self, and are clearly not moves with a \"hit\" or \"no hit\" consideration.\n\nAnother way to think of it would be that Substitute could only stop things that you could use Protect against. You could use Protect against Pain Split, but not against Dragon Dance. So Substitute stops Pain Split, but not Dragon Dance.\n\nDid that make any sense?\n\nJust in case it didn't: how about just <strong>my</strong> word on it then?\n\nokay here goes\n\nI, Doxy, First of My Name, King of the Sandile and the First Vespiquen, Lord of the Seven Pokemon Tabletop Forums, and Moderator of the Realm, hereby declare that Substitute does not redirect and nullify use of Self-Range Moves.

Maybe Sympathetic Drives can install Psionic Blades to grant the 2 weapon moves and Psycho Cut?\n\nA368: ...based on Doxy's logic for why self-targetting status moves work through Substitute, I would say that it still protects against Phantom Force (and similar moves), because Substitute isn't explicitly bypassed by Phantom Force's effect, and still \"hits\", so it would hit the substitute.\n\nA369: Substitutes are immune to Status MOVES as well as Status AFFLICTIONS. Corrosive Toxins allows you to bypass immunity to Status Afflictions with Toxic, but not immunity to Status Moves.

As such, the user can only benefit from Type Strategist (Psychic) being triggered off Magic Coat, and not say a Type Strategist (Poison) if they were reflecting a Toxic."

It just means the character has an instrument that can be played, which is basically assumed for the Musician class.\nI couldn't point you to where exactly it was said but I've seen general advise along the lines of \"If it doesn't have a mechanical effect, don't give it a price. Money can be hard to come by in PTU games and it should be reserved for restoratives, pok&#195;&#169;balls or items with effects. Things like clothes, food or staying in inns, unless they provide a buff, should just be things the characters are able to pick up without spending hard earned Pok&#195;&#169;yen.\"\n\nThe point being: Don't give the above guitar a cost. If the character in question starts as a musician, have it in their background that that's what they play. One of my players started with an acoustic but there's no reason not to use this electric one instead. It's just the fluff of how they do their musician stuff."

Also, do those moves count against your TM/HM/Tutor move count?\n\n2) Say I learn a move in an earlier stage of evolution that has that move on one of its natural move lists and then evolve into a pokemon that does not have the move available or can only learn the move through a TM/HM/Tutor, does the move change from being a natural move to being a TM/tutor move now?\nFor example: A Nuzleaf learns Razor Wind at Level 20 through leveling up, however after evolving into a Shiftry, Razor Wind is only able to be learned as a TM and is no longer on that pokemon's natural move list. Does Razor Wind now count against the number of TM/tutor moves on my move list?",

I found some more looking at the Mudkip line where there are some egg moves that don't translate at all up to the marshtomp or swampert evolutions (sludge and ice ball being examples). and the piplup line as well. It seems the biggest conflict is the egg move list being considered as a natural move list for the base form, but the lack of that move list in the further evolutions. In that case, are the egg moves supposed to be the same for the entire evolution line?"

        "A": [
            "A570: The way I see it, it'd work like this:\n\nStep 1. Your Pok&#195;&#169;mon uses a Threaded Shift to reach the opponent. They're a living, unwilling target, so it needs a status attack, which will normally be AC 6 with a range of 4 meters. (If they have the Precise Threadings Pok&#195;&#169; Edge, their range is boosted to 6 and the AC is only 3.) Assuming the Pok&#195;&#169;mon is lighter than the opponent, they'll be pulled up to them. (Otherwise you'll just drag the opponent down.)\n\nStep 2. The Pok&#195;&#169;mon makes a Grapple maneuver. This is guesswork on my part, but if you want to stay up there you're gonna have to hang on somehow. Assuming it succeeds, both the Pok&#195;&#169;mon and the opponent are now Grappled, which means it's not going anywhere unless it gets free or at least gains Dominance. Since Threaded is a Shift Action and Grapple is a Standard, that's the end of the Pok&#195;&#169;mon's turn.\n(Side note: I don't think it's RAW, but if I were running it, I'd probably say that if your Pok&#195;&#169;mon is bigger than the opponent's Staggering Weight Limit, you both fall out of the sky at this point and take appropriate falling damage. Again, not RAW, if only because it's an edge case that isn't covered.)\n\nStep 3. Opponent's turn! They have a chance to contest the grapple and either gain Dominance themselves or end the grapple. If they end the grapple, you're probably getting dropped.\n\nStep 4. Your turn again! Assuming you're still Grappling, you may now use a Move on the target (or, if you've still got Dominance in the grapple, you can make a Struggle attack that auto-hits as a Full Action). Since you're not targeting someone outside the grapple, there's no AC penalty. Now your only problem is getting down.\n\nIf you don't Grapple, I think RAW-wise you start falling as soon as you get up there, which doesn't give you any time to make an attack. Very complicated, but if your GM doesn't tear their hair out over it you might just get style points. (Also, ask your GM before you try to pull this, they may interpret the rules differently than me. YMMV and all.)",

The user gains a +1 Accuracy Bonus to Bone Club, Bonemerang, and Bone Rush.

The logic is that cubone has other moves like Bonemerang that represent throwing the bone club and it returning, so Fling + Bone Wielder would make the Thick Club work the same way.\n\nMy interpretation is that the use of Fling throws the item, meaning \"the user wishes it\" to be thrown. The Move doesn't force the user to lose the item, because it's a choice to activate that. If you don't want to lose the Thick Club, don't Fling it. This has been my ruling so far, though we're far too early in the game for it to have come up in action yet. Just talking build theory for the future. I don't particularly want to step on my player's ideas, but I also don't particularly think it follows the wording or intention of the rules.\n\nApparently it's common to build a Cubone with Bone Wielder and a Thick Club explicitly to use Fling without losing the thrown item. Is this setup possible? Is there a point to it besides type coverage? (The net result is that both Fling and Bonemerang become AC2, DB7, Range 6 moves, but Bonemerang is Ground with Double Strike and Fling is Dark with no other perks. I don't see the advantage.)"

Even at +4 combat stages (35 defense) you'll still only have 6 Defense evasion due to the cap. If you want to increase evasion beyond that, you'll need other effects, such as a shield. Using a light shield would bring the previous example character to 7 defense evasion (5 from stats, 2 from shield) at +0 combat stages, and 8 defense evasion (6 from stats, 2 from shield) at +2 or more combat stages, and allow them to ready the shield for 9 defense evasion (5-6 from stats, 4 from shield, capped at +9 total)",

If so, this is particularly confusing, as Evasion changes are tracked like combat stages and cap at +6/-6, but they technically aren't combat stages for effects like Punishment, Psych Up, or other Moves that track combat stages.\n\nIn any case, PTU Core 1.05 p234: <strong>No matter from which sources you receive Evasion, you may only raise a Move&#226;&#128;&#153;s Accuracy Check by a max of +9.</strong> Stats can give you up to +6 physical/special/speed evasion at 30 defense/spdef/speed respectively, no matter how you got your stat to those values. Minimize gives you +4 evasion, while being hit by Sweet Scent gives you -2. A shield gives you +1, as does Inspired Training. If you had all of the above, you would have +6+4-2+1+1 = +10 evasion, and you would raise Accuracy Checks by +9 as that is the cap, so a simple AC2 Tackle would need to roll an 11 or better on the accuracy roll to hit you.\n\nNote that effects like Hustle and Sand Attack/Blindness apply a penalty to accuracy rolls, they don't modify the Accuracy Check value. Similarly, accuracy bonuses such as from Focused Training are added to the roll, not subtracted from Accuracy Check. None of these impact the hard +9 evasion cap. However, Accuracy has its own caps at +6/-6, so a February Playtest No Guard (+3 to attacks) with Focused Training as Training and Orders would only receive +1 accuracy from a use of Double Team (usually +2).\n\nEDIT: A special case comes to mind:\n\n<spoiler>Besides these base values for evasion, Moves and\neffects can raise or lower Evasion. These extra Changes\nin Evasion apply to all types of Evasion, and stack on\ntop. Any time Combat Stages would be cleared, these\nbonuses to Evasion are cleared as well. Much like\nCombat Stages; it has a minimum of -6 and a max of +6.\nNegative Evasion can erase Evasion from other sources,\nbut does not increase the Accuracy of an enemy&#226;&#128;&#153;s Moves.</spoiler>\nSay that a pok&#195;&#169;mon has +0 evasion from stats due to some very interesting glass cannon build, and through some combination of Minimize and PP Up they max out their Evasion 'stages' at +6. If they then received Inspired Training as both Training and Orders, I believe that they would still have +6 evasion. The only Move that raises Evasion for more than one attack is Minimize which is Scene and +4, so this seems unlikely to come up, but it's interesting. Also amusing is that it isn't entirely clear whether an effect that clears Combat Stages would also negate the Evasion boost of Inspired Training (or the accuracy boost of Focused Training, for that matter), or Evasion from items like Bright Powder. I'd rule these as changing Default Evasion, of course, but the rules in this area aren't used enough to be clarified.\n\nAlso interesting: Total Blindness gives a -10 penalty to accuracy, which caps at -6. I suppose this means that it cancels out bonuses up to +4 accuracy, but if this is the intent then it's not very intuitive, much like how a Hustle pok&#195;&#169;mon will effectively only get -4 accuracy from Blindness due to the pre-existing -2 (though it's also likely they have accuracy boosts in place to cancel the Hustle penalty, so it usually evens out).",

Of course, the HP bars aren't going to be much use without a decent HP stat, and those bars also entail much more than more hit points, including extra turns and potential minions.

            "Let me paint a quick scenario of how this got brought up so I can make use your appreciated answers for later reference; \n\nThe PCs ended up giving the current area's boss a surprise round due to recklessly getting too close too quickly into its main territory, so the battle begins and since they were caught off guard, one PC ended up reacting accordingly to their character but managed to make things slightly worse by doing so, gaining aggro and ending up face first on the floor along with their one Poke; an Espurr. The Swarmlord PC who's been using Threaded like it's going out of style along with their own Poke; a Joltik decides to try and get the knocked out PC and their Pokemon out of harm's way with it, understandable so far. So the Swarmlord threading the PC and Joltik threading the Espurr hit the AC check on two unconscious beings, the Espurr is Weight Class 1(7.7lbs) so Joltik would still be borderline between heavy lifting and staggering on the power chart from only having a Power of 1 while the Swarmlord has a Power of 6 with the PC he's pulling having a weight class of 4 but due to the scavenging they were doing pushed the KO'd PC almost halfway into weight class 6, so he's also pulling a staggering weight for him. So with all the information put into consideration we also have the whole situation of the boss being directly in front of the knocked out PC who's a very experienced fighter of sorts being more than capable of simply stepping on the PC currently being pulled away from him since he's a large weight class 7+ NPC. So my questions come as followed;\n\n\n\nQ685: When it comes to the Threaded Capability on both Swarmlords or Pokemon, what are the rules or limits when it comes to pulling something towards them? Do they roll a Combat or Athletics to do a Pull Maneuver? Or is there a different sort of mechanic for it and would it count as a full-round action?\n\n\nQ686: Does an unconscious body still require an AC check for something like Threaded whether it's willing or not? \n\n\nQ687: Would a PC or NPC like the described boss be more than capable of simply using their Attack of Opportunity to step on someone or something being pulled away from them if it's sitting still right in front of them and easily able to be stepped on for that matter?"

        "A": [
            "A685: The lighter object is simply moved adjacent to the heavier one. It is specifically listed to be a SHIFT action. If the swarmlord is heavier than the other PC, they would be able to move them with no check required (barring the possible accuracy check for unwilling-ness), but Joltik is much lighter than Espurr, so it would be unable to move the Espurr using threaded.\n\nA687: Being forced out of a square (such as by being the target of a Threaded Shift) is not shifting, or any of the other actions listed to allow an attack of opportunity, so strictly RAW, this is not possible. However, I don't think it would be unreasonable to rule otherwise."

            "I've been curious for some time about Hazards and wished to clear this from my mind as well, in the Hazard keyword it's pretty much;\n\n<quote>Hazard: If a Move has the Hazard keyword, the effect covers a portion of the field of battle. A Hazard only affects the foes under certain circumstances. You may put extra Layers of the Move with Hazard if the Move allows, but only one per usage of the Move.</quote>\n\nWith this and my knowledge so far of the Hazard moves, my questions are as followed;\n\nQ688: When it comes to Hazards the part where it mentions the extra layers if the move \"allows\" it and from what I've seen that's only really mentioned in Toxic Spikes/Toxic Caltrops but the thing about what it mentions is how \"if\" you have it layered, it causes the Badly Poisoned status instead of just the Poisoned status, is there somewhere else more specific where it mentions whether or not it's allowed or is it simply more of a \"It's just small spikes so common sense says yes.\" sort of deals?\n\nQ689: Regarding the previous question, considering the whole layering thing is allowed for many trap Hazards, would it mean that one could layer Stealth Rocks+Caltrops+Toxic Caltrops+Sticky Web+Survival Trapper Hazard+Overwatch in one square alone? As ridiculous as it sounds, it's made me curious considering there isn't a place stating it \"isn't\" allowed.\n\nQ690: When it comes to the Hazard Stealth Rock it specifically states; \"A Pok&#195;&#169;mon who has been hit by a Stealth Rock Hazard cannot get hit by another in the same encounter until it is returned to a Pok&#195;&#169; Ball and then sent back out.\" and it seems like a rule more sorted for like a legal battle of sorts in a tournament/Gym/League and etc. But what if the one triggering the Hazard is a trainer/PC? Would the trainer/PC trigger any they come across regardless of the limit rule? Or would again common sense make it so it follows the same rule in and out of official rule book battles in the streets or deadly battlefields?"

        "A": [
            "A688: RAW, the only Hazard that can be layered is Toxic Spikes, since it's the only one which states that it can be. Layering Spikes makes sense, but even a weak Push effect that only pushes 1 meter(say, with the Push Combat Maneuver) could do 20% of an opponent's health on a double layer of Spikes, which is pretty powerful. Telekinetics can do that as a Swift Action, and a few Moves do it automatically.\n\nA689: It's not explicitly stated, but I would only allow one Hazard per square; again, that's a very powerful effect. The exception to this is the Trickster Class' Shell Game, which does state it can place multiple Hazards on the same square.\n\nA690: That's just a property of the Move Stealth Rock - it may not make a lot of sense, but it's a balancing factor, much like not being able to just tell all your Pokemon to attack at once. Also, Pokemon and Trainers are interchangeable in most circumstances, outside Class abilities and the like that specifically call one out."

Short answer is no, but long answer - Page 338 references that Melee has a distance of 1, and can therefore only hit a target at 1 meter from them (meaning they're unable to attack at range 0 and hit themself instead). Assuming Ranged X follows the same ruling and can't pick '0' as a range, then it cannot. I could be incorrect about this and followup may definitely be needed, but that appears to be Rules As Intended. It also kinda makes the Self range redundant if it could just be labeled as Ranged 0 instead."

An instant +4 Atk CS from Swords Dance can make it's damage quite scary, and +4 Sp Def from Amnesia (which it learns naturally) can certainly help it tank up. If going the Dancer route, you can basically give it a similar boost to whatever stat you feel it needs (maybe Def to pair with Amnesia for proper tankiness, aided further by that 5 DR).\n\nIf you want to go all-in on this, you can grab Trickster for Encore Performance, so you can use one of these +CS moves and immediately Hyper Fang afterwards, so you're not even losing a turn. (Just watch your opponent cry as you hit him with that super-charged Hyper Fang with +4 Atk CS on the very first round!)

This is also something of a gut feeling for me so apologies if it's hard to follow my logic.\n\nA pre-1.06 mixed attacker or twisted power type effect for defenses would be generically good, whereas current mixed attacker is only for, well, mixed attackers. The playtest version is also sort of generically good though.\n\nHaving had a GM who tried to implement a \"mixed defender\" homebrew, I'll tell you that it's basically free stats with the only downside being it costs TP (and whether this matters or not depends on your build, really). Defenses are always useful pretty much no matter the build, even if attack stats tend to be much better. Having 30/30 in Defense and Special Defense is fine, the only weakness is that those stats are relatively weak right now because attackers don't invest in their attack stats equally (why bother when you could just have 50 special attack?).\n\nA mixed defender could undo that to a degree, but I think that it moves towards homogenizing physical/special, which is bad. If both offensively and defensively you only have to invest in one stat to get the other, why have a split?"

So you could be a 9 injuries, get the 10th from reaching 0, and then ignoring it via 1 AP. Of course that only works once per battle pper mon, and if you get massive damage you're screwed, but, it is a thing you can do."

My interpretation of this is that each half hour of normal rest you gain 1/16th Max HP back but that would mean that (assuming no injuries) if you sleep for 8 hours like after a normal day of being outside you would be full health. But that doesnt seam correct since right after the book goes to say that \"You may continue to rest further a er this time, but Hit Points will not be regained\" which leads me to think that if you rest for 8 hours you could potentially not be full health.

Your resistances stay the same - so your Dermal Plating Camerupt now takes Super-Effective damage from Physical Water and Ground moves and still takes Super-Super-Effective damage from Special moves in those types. (The actual issue with the multipliers is that Solid Rock uses the older, larger multipliers from previous editions and appears to be reducing them to what are now the standard values - i.e. 1.5x for a SE hit and 2x for an SSE hit. Presumably it's actually meant to use the same modifiers as Filter - i.e. 1.25x and 1.5x. Presumably this just got missed in editing the 1.05 corebook.)\n\nWith Playtest Solid Rock it's pretty straightforward - it gives you +5 DR against Super-Effective attacks, so now Solid Rock would only activate on Physical attacks that would be Super Super Effective without Dermal Plating (and still works like normal on Special Attacks). Remember that DR applies before the weakness multiplier, same time you'd reduce damage for your defensive stats, so you effectively have more like 7 DR against SE attacks and 10 against SSE attacks."

            "A769a: As far as I can tell this is just GM ruling, although remember anyone can wake up anyone else as a standard action. That said, some quick maths gives an average of four rounds, so having them wake up naturally within a minute of combat ending definitely isn't unreasonable or anything.\n\nA769b: Extended skill check length is purely GM discretion and is meant to be based off how time consuming it is, maybe something like constructing a superweapon or piece of experimental machinery you only roll once per day, as the task is expected to last days. Maybe something like picking a complex lock only takes ten minutes per attempt? It's all up to the GM. Remember, it should require 2 to 5 times the normal DC, so just get the DC, divide by their average skill check, and then divide how long you want it to take to get an approximate idea of how long it should be.\n\nTaking the example of a chest, maybe the players have got some locked chest with a particularly complex lock and have to try and safely unlock it to not trip any traps. Choosing a multiplier of 4 to represent being quite difficult, and a base DC of 16, something that would normally be relatively trivial for a Master ranked skill check (Survival? Technology?). Then say you want it to take 6 hours to do, so you've got an extended DC of 64, if you actually have a Master that'd be slightly over 3 checks, enough so that if you considered it something which can be too difficult they should have about a 50/50 chance without any modifiers. You'd also get a time per check of 2 hours.\n\nOnly the first bit is rules though note, the rest is just how I'd probably treat it if it came up.\n\nA770: Under Move Keywords, Interrupt is on page 340, Priority on 341.\n\nThe answer seems to be both, sort of, which I'd interpret as if you use an Interrupt you'll use that action and only that action as in Priority (Limited), and if you've already used the relevant action/s in that round it will instead give up those actions in the following round as in Priority (Advanced).

Taking those two concepts together, you can use Round Trip just fine (because it's an action the trainer takes rather than the Pok&#195;&#169;mon) but the new Pok&#195;&#169;mon you send out still won't be able to act.\n\nA774: My reading is that you get a Pok&#195;&#169;mon turn every round even if you don't have a Pok&#195;&#169;mon out to take it in. So recalling an Exhausted mon and just not sending a Pok&#195;&#169;mon out for the next turn would indeed bypass the Exhaust. This does have the advantage of not leaving a Pok&#195;&#169;mon vulnerable to attack but unable to act, and leaves a trainer a standard action (a full switch is a standard action but recalling or releasing is only a shift)... but then you still need to use your shift the following round to send out a new Pok&#195;&#169;mon (or indeed the old one).\n\nWhether the Pok&#195;&#169;mon is still Exhausted when it's sent out is a little more ambiguous, but running with my interpretation above I'd say that an Exhausted Pok&#195;&#169;mon can recover just as well in their ball as on the field. (In the video games, at least, you're still recharging while flinched or asleep so if you wake up/when you become unflinched the following round you're ready to go again. An interaction between Roar and exhaust moves in the games would be more definitive but I can't find any data on that.)\n\nThis is just my interpretation though, so someone can feel free to smack me if I'm wrong."

            "A: 776 If the quote says \"Cannot take Shift Actions\" than it can't get any simpler RAW.  You cannot take shift actions.  Nor can you give up your Standard action to take a shift action, because you cannot take Shift Actions.  Thus, any sort of activity categorized as a Shift Action is one you cannot take.  This includes, but is not limited to, using your movement capability to shift.\n\n<quote>\nShift Actions: The Shift Action is the most\nstraightforward action during a Pok&#195;&#169;mon or Trainer&#226;&#128;&#153;s\nturn; it&#226;&#128;&#153;s simply used for movement most of the time.\nTrainers may hand other Trainers a small item they\nhave on hand as part of a Shift Action, as long as the ally\nis adjacent at either the beginning or end of the shift.

Nor can you use features such as Heightened Intensity from Martial Artist, which requires the use of a Shift Action to activate.  As you are currently unable to take Shift Actions, you cannot use that feature.\n\nSo returning to grappling, you can't take Shift Actions.  You are also prohibited from taking other actions that would allow you to Shift (note that shifting and using a Shift Action are distinctly seperate concepts, even though the vast majority of Shift Actions are used to shift).  So you also couldn't use class features (Skirmisher I think) to disengage as a Swift Action because that would cause you to shift.\n\nThe PhB is clear here in terms of Rules as Written.

Of course, if I did do Acrobatics being allowed I'd probably also stick to a stricter ruling for Versatile Wardrobe, so if they lose the item they can't swap to another, as by RAW it only seems to allow you to swap between items so without an item equipped you're not actually swapping a Held Item for something else. If they lose their item well enough to use Acrobatics, they'll also have to suffer through it being trickier to get an item back.\n\nAcrobatics is presumably treating it as if held items impair the pokemon however, and wearing the item somehow that doesn't boost it is still wearing the item, so can presumably still impair it."

Ordinary Priority actions <em>do not</em> allow you to act if you've already done so this round.\nPriority (Limited) actions are like normal Priority actions, but they don't allow you to take your whole turn. The most common Priority (Limited) actions are [Orders] features; you can throw them out whenever you like but you still have to wait for your initiative to Shift.\nPriority (Advanced) actions are like normal Priority actions, but they <em>do</em> allow you to act if you've already done so. This uses up your action for the next round. If I recall correctly you cannot use Priority (Advanced) to use up actions multiple turns ahead, so you still only get to use them once per round even if frequency permits.\nInterrupts (including Shield moves) and Reactions act essentially like they're both (Limited) <em>and</em> (Advanced). So you're perfectly capable of using Counter if you've already acted that turn, but it uses up your action for the next turn. This means, again, you can only Counter once a round."

Doesn't really matter how they get them, I suppose) Basically, can a Pokemon simultaneously know a base move, and a custom move created from said base move, at the same time?\n\nI'm kind of thinking of Smeargle as a reference, since it essentially learns the same move several times for the express purpose of turning it into other moves.\n\nEdit: to be clear, I'm not attempting to bypass frequency restrictions; I would assume both moves would share the frequency of the base move. I essentially am wondering if you could *conditionally* activate the bonus features of a signature move, by having the option of choosing between it and the move it was based on. Say you have a move that can target allies or enemies, and don't want to hit your allies with penalties added by the signature modification.", 
            "reQ821: Do you know if it says anywhere in the book that you can't learn the same move twice? It was always that way in the handhelds and I'm assuming it still is, but I can't find it anywhere...\n\nSection on a Pokemon gaining a level:\n<spoiler>Next, there is the possibility your Pok&#195;&#169;mon may learn a Move or Evolve. Check its Pok&#195;&#169;dex Entry to see if either of these happens. If a Pok&#195;&#169;mon evolves, make sure to then check its new form&#226;&#128;&#153;s Move List to see if it learned any Moves that Level. You may choose not to Evolve your Pok&#195;&#169;mon if you wish.</spoiler>\n\nBlurb on moves from the Pokemon basic rules intro:\n<spoiler>11. Move List -- Moves are the primary way a Pok&#195;&#169;mon fights in battle, and they can learn them in four ways -- natural level up, inherited egg moves, from TMs and HMs, and from Move Tutors.</spoiler>\n\nSection on moves in Pokemon basic rules:\n<spoiler>Moves are a Pok&#195;&#169;mon&#226;&#128;&#153;s battle techniques and have the biggest influence on their combat ability. Pok&#195;&#169;mon may learn a maximum of 6 Moves from all sources combined. However, certain Abilities and Features may allow a Pok&#195;&#169;mon to bypass this limit. A Pok&#195;&#169;mon may fill as many of its Move slots as it likes with Moves from its Natural Move List. This includes all Moves gained from Level Up, all Egg Moves, and all Tutor Moves marked with an (N). However, no more than 3 of a Pok&#195;&#169;mon&#226;&#128;&#153;s Moves may be from TMs and Move Tutors, with the exception of the Natural Tutor Moves noted above. Any Feature that requires Tutor Points to cause a Pok&#195;&#169;mon to learn Moves is considered a Tutor.\nIf a Pok&#195;&#169;mon learns a Move via TM or Move Tutor that it can later learn via Level Up, once the Pok&#195;&#169;mon has the opportunity to learn it naturally, that Move becomes counted as a &#226;&#128;&#156;Natural&#226;&#128;&#157; Move for the purposes of the 3-TM/Tutor Move Limit. Unlike Pok&#195;&#169;mon, Trainers have no limit to the number of Moves they may learn.</spoiler>\n\nRelevant bit from the Tutors and other services section:\n<spoiler>Occasionally, your players may want access to a service provided by Class Features -- a Move Tutor, for example,or perhaps a breeder. The availability for these services depends on you, and you should consider your setting before making any service available. That said, below are some of the more common NPC services accompanied by recommended frequencies of availability and prices. Commonly available services probably can be given out pretty freely without hurting anything. &#226;&#128;&#156;Possibly&#226;&#128;&#157; and &#226;&#128;&#156;Rarely&#226;&#128;&#157; available services should be considered a bit more before inserting them into your setting. Also note, you should of course mix and match across rarity levels as it suits you; A breeder with Master Rank Pok&#195;&#169;mon Education could only have Rattatas and Pidgeys for adoption, for example.\n\nSpecialist Tutors: These Tutors have taken the &#226;&#128;&#156;Tutoring&#226;&#128;&#157; Feature, and can teach only a single specific Move to Pok&#195;&#169;mon that could learn that Move via Level-Up, TM, Egg-Move list, or Move Tutor. Having one of these per town can be an interesting way to keep players looking forward to new locations. Prices should vary from $1000 to $3000, depending on the strength of the \nMove in question.\n\nGeneralist Tutors: These Tutors have taken Mentor Features, and are rarer than Specialist Tutors and often more expensive, but can provide varied services. Commonly: Latent Potential ($800)\nPossibly: Move Tutor (Varies Per Move), Corrective Learning ($1200)\nRarely: Changing Viewpoints ($2500), Versatile Teachings ($2500)</spoiler>\n\nThe move section from Indices and Reference:\n<spoiler>Moves are the main forms of Pok&#195;&#169;mon Attacks in Pok&#195;&#169;mon Tabletop United. Pok&#195;&#169;mon may know a maximum of 6 Moves; Trainers may know as many Moves as their Features allow. Moves are, unless stated otherwise, performed as a Standard Action. Moves in this documented are presented like this...\n\nMove: The first line contains the Name of the Move. This is of course, what you use to keep track of the Move, and write down in your Pok&#195;&#169;mon&#226;&#128;&#153;s Move List.\nType: Next is the Elemental Type of the Move. There are Bug, Dark, Dragon, Electric, Fairy, Fighting, Fire, Flying, Ghost, Grass, Ground, Ice, Normal, Poison, Psychic, Rock, Steel and Water Moves! This will determine Type Effectiveness since Moves are broken up by their respective Type.\nFrequency : The Frequency is the rate of use. There are five levels of Frequency for Moves. \n&#194;&#187; At-Will means your Pok&#195;&#169;mon can perform the attack as often as it&#226;&#128;&#153;d like, with no rest needed to perform the attack again.\n&#194;&#187; EOT is an abbreviation for Every Other Turn, and it means your Pok&#195;&#169;mon can perform the move once every other turn. If your Pok&#195;&#169;mon uses an EOT frequency Move outside of battle, it would need ten seconds of rest before performing the move again. \n&#194;&#187; Scene X: This Frequency means this Move can be performed X times per Scene. Moves that simply have the Scene Frequency without a number can be performed once a Scene. Moves that can be used multiple times a Scene can still only be used Every Other Turn within a Scene and not on consecutive turns. \n&#194;&#187; Daily is the lowest Frequency. This Move&#226;&#128;&#153;s Frequency is only refreshed by an Extended Rest, or by a visit to the Pok&#195;&#169;mon Center. Moves that can be used multiple times Daily can still only be used once a Scene and not multiple times within the same Scene. \n&#194;&#187; Static, like with Features, means this Move has some effect that is always granted to the user, as long as they know this Move.\nAccuracy Check: The Accuracy Check is used when a Pok&#195;&#169;mon uses a Move as an Attack. The Accuracy Check is the number you need to match or exceed on your Accuracy Roll in order for the Attack to connect to your target. See the Combat chapter for details.\nDamage Base: This indicates the base amount of damage dealt. See the &#226;&#128;&#152;Damage&#226;&#128;&#153; section in the Combat Chapter for more details (page 236). Many Abilities and other effects can modify Damage Bases.\n\nClass: Class will denote whether the attack is Physical, Special or Status. Physical Attacks are resisted by Defense; Special Attacks are resisted by Special Defense. Some attacks may be Physical or Special but not have Damage Dice Rolls; that means the damage these attacks do still interact with other effects such as Counter or Mirror Coat that specify a damage class. Status Moves are simply moves that are neither Physical nor Special.\nRange: Range specifies the distance in meters from which the Move can hit. Keywords are also inserted in this line; see the following section for a detail of keywords. Besides the standard numerical distances, other common distances include Melee, Self, and Field. Self moves simply target the user; Melee Moves have a range of 1, and thus must target an adjacent target. The Field Range drops an effect on the entire area where the battle is taking place. When using area-of-effect Moves, such as ones with the Burst or Cone keywords, make a single Accuracy Roll for the entire attack.\nEffect: The Effect lists what the attack does in addition to the Move&#226;&#128;&#153;s damage. Certain effects will only occur if, during Accuracy Roll, a certain number or higher is rolled. Effects do not activate unless the Move hits. Effect Ranges can be extended by other effects. For example, an effect that triggers on 18+ that has its Effect Range extended by +2 now triggers on 16+.\nEffects such as Features and Abilities that extend the Critical Hit or Effect Ranges of a Move cannot extend them by more than a total of +6 from their natural ranges. \nContest Type/Effect: These two Contest Fields indicate what Contest Type the Move is tied to. There are only 5 different Contest Types: Beauty, Cool, Cute, Smart, and Tough. The Contest Effect determines what effect the move has in Contests. See the Contest chapter for more.\nSpecial: Some Moves grant Capabilities to Pok&#195;&#169;mon and Trainers learning the Move. When a Move is forgotten, all Capabilities granted by the Move are also lost.</spoiler>\n\n\nreQ820: I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to reference; the word 'Attack' does not appear anywhere under the Chronicler's entry?"

Lot of work without a tool and may not make for the feeling of the largest map.\n2: Describe the route and their travel narratively, with things they can interact with without needing to be plopped down on a map, and have one or two maps on hand so when they interact with something worth a map, like Pok&#195;&#169;mon for combat, you can swap into map time.\n3: Similar to 2, you have all the major parts of a route mapped out, an example would be a cave system I did, I had entreance/exits mapped, and then major points down each of the forked path. Then describe the transitions between these maps narratively, or have one flow right into the other if you prefer."

If so, I feel like it could do with being specifically pointed out in the Expend Momentum feat's text in 2.0 (assuming that the feat or anything similar exists at all in 2.0, granted) that accuracy rolls made this don't impact effect ranges or crits, and you still need to actually roll a d20 to decide those.  The rules say that \"modifiers to Accuracy Rolls do not affect effects from Moves that occur upon specific dice results\", but RAW the Expend Momentum thing (and more arguably, Coordinator's Reliable Performance feat), aren't \"modifiers\" in the usual sense of the word.  The fact Expend Momentum applies to *any* d20 roll also lends to the impression that it's the entire actual roll that's being forced, Secondary Effects and all.  So Yeah.  What's the RAI here?"

For example if you use hit 3 Pokemon with an AOE attack and it is super effective against 2 of them, the wording is specified so you do not increase your damage roll against all of them by +10, you treat the damage roll for the 2 super effective targets as +5 to the damage roll and the other Pokemon is treated normally.\n\nFor effects like Oblivion Wing: \"The user gains Hit Points equal to Oblivion Wing&#226;&#128;&#153;s Damage Roll\"  The phrasing \"the target treats\" means  to me that the Pokemon using oblivion wing or an ability/move with a similar effect would not gain benefits from the extra +5 on the damage roll, as we do not treat the damage roll as +5 for the user.\n\nA508:  This interaction is strange because the effects of the Charge Beam happen after the attack hits(After the accuracy roll).\n\nQuoting from the rulebook \"Effect Range: Refers to the likelihood of activation of effects that occur dependent on accuracy roll. For example, Ember has an Effect Range of 18-20. If an Effect increases this Effect Range by +2, it would then be 16-20.\"\n\n\"Accuracy Roll: A d20 roll made to use an attack or Move against a foe.\"\n\nBased off this wording, and the wording of charge beams boost, it would seem RAW, that no it does not benefit from effect ranges as it does not happen during the accuracy roll.

If it was worded you can roll dice based on your Pokemon education roll than I would say you could apply your charm bonuses instead. I see it as you are roleplaying that your interaction is coming from your understanding of Pokemon rather than a charming personality, it makes more sense to add Pokemon Education bonuses than charm bonuses.  I think it is written this way because the bonuses you could get otherwise could be very abusable and make almost all normal DC checks almost guranteed.

Then, you can combine the result with another Oran Berry Preserve. This can be repeated until you run out of Oran Berry Preserves, by which point your Snack will heal 50 HP on top of the Leftovers effect. With enough berries, money, and time, a Chef could create a Tasty Snack (of whichever type works best for the consumer) that also cures all status conditions, raises all combat stages, accuracy, and crit range to +6, fully restores HP, grants Leftovers regeneration, restores all their Scene moves, and weaken any super-effective or Normal-type move while also KOing (or killing, if you prefer) the user of the move.

I remembered reading somewhere that pass moves dont grant extra movement but couldnt find it in the core rules, <spoiler>At any point during a Shift, the user may declare a\nmove with the Pass keyword. Once the Move is declared,\nthe user may move forward only in a straight line, for up\nto 4 meters, treating foes as Regular Terrain and moving\nthrough any enemies in its path. The user must end in\nan empty square. The Pass Move attacks all targets in\neach square it dashes through, but each target may be\nhit only once. The user must end their Shift at the end\nof the dash. Shifting as a result of the Pass keyword does\nnot provoke Attacks of Opportunity.</spoiler>\n\n so i scoured the forums and finall found the post where castfromhp said that pass moves are not supposed to add to a users movement capabilities. I showed my GM and he said since the admin said thats how its supposed to work (even though it isnt written) then thats how we will play from that point forward. \n\nAnother example was one post about wind runners and their flight/levitate ability.

Or does it not work that way? </quote>Quick note, you should number your question like the others are in this thread, for organization's sake. \n\nThat said, here's your answer from page 236 of the core book: \"An Accuracy Roll is always simply 1d20, but is modified by the user&#226;&#128;&#153;s Accuracy and by certain Moves and other effects. Note that modifiers to Accuracy Rolls do not affect effects from Moves that occur upon specific dice results, or that increase Critical Hit range. For example, if you use Flamethrower with an Accuracy Bonus of +4 and roll a 16 on d20 before adding 4, this would neither be a Critical Hit, nor inflict a Burn.\"\n\nSo in your example, that 15 does not result in a crit.",

The one with Dominance can't use moves because they're concentrating on maintaining the grapple, and the theoretical ability to damage or drag around the one without; meanwhile the one without Dominance still has to deal with the downsides of being Grappled even if they can still technically attack out of it. They can't move, it's harder for them to hit anyone but the guy holding them down, and they can't dodge attacks.

        "Hey, I had a question about pok&#195;&#169;mon diets, mainly, I was wondering why the following families are all Herbivores. Namely, Espurr, Furret,  Stunky, Fenekin, Vulpix, Zorua, Barboach, Goldeen, Finneon,  Lanturn, Quilfish, Relicanth, Alomomola, Stunfisk, Staryu, Poliwag, Croagunk, Tympole, Froakie, Spheal, Horsea,  Dwebble, Omanyte, Kabuto, Ducklett, Psyduck, Farfetch'd, Delibird, Piplup, Torchic,  Spritzee, Natu, Swablu, Sigilyph,  Woobat, Spoink, Tepig,  Kecleon, Treeko, Breloom,  Snivy, Oshawott, Venipede, Beedrill, Kricketot and Pinsir. Felines are known carnivores that occasionally eat plants for some reason, ferrets are definitely omnivores, as are skunks. Foxes, like felines and most wild canines, are primarily carnivores. Some fish eat plant matter, but most eat insects, invertebrates and fish, carp and bass do and angler fish, puffer fish and sunfish each eat at least some of these. Coelacanth is known to be a predator, so that makes it at least a carnivore. Chickens, ducks, all sorts of water foal, as well as most birds are somewhere between carnivores and omnivores, chickens will eat meat, ducks hunt fish, as do penguins, and most birds eat insects though I was surprised to learn that Ostritches mainly eat plants but will eat insects, so I'd give doduo a pass. Frogs/Toads/Lizards as insectivores are carnivores and its known that large enough toads will eat a mouse. Snakes are known as carnivores and Pigs are omnivores, and they'll eat almost anything. Hermit Crabs are known to commit cannibalism, so, they're even more intense than just carnivores. Seals eat fish, and Seel's family is even listed as carnivorous, so Spheal not being a carnivore is extra strange, though I guess it does transition to omnivore, which I guess is strange because I don't think sea lions or walruses eat any plants. I was surprised to learn that Seahorses are technically predators, I was just gonna let that pass until I looked it up due to Skrelp being carnivores. Otters are famous for their method of eating clams, so they're clearly not herbivores. While Beedrill has bee in its name, it's certainly got more in common with wasps, which are carnivorous. Pinisir's horns are supposed to be for crushing prey, which is really weird if you hunt plants? Centipedes eat bugs, though milipedes are herbivores, however, of these only centipedes are venomous, so while herbivore would make sense on a millipede, it's more likely that venipede is a centipede. Crickets are omnivores, if you leave too many of them in a cage with a lizard, they'll eat the lizard alive once it becomes night time, which is horrible. I listed Woobat, though I know fruit bats do exist and would totally accept that as an answer, but I figured I'd ask anyways. Granted, I can't actually know the diets of ammonites and trilobites, but evidence suggests that they fed on other creatures at the time. I forgot to list all the mice pok&#195;&#169;mon, I think they're all listed as Herbivores, Pikachu, Raticate, Plusle/Minun, and D&#195;&#169;denne all are at least and mice also known to be omnivorous. Why are Charmander, Pidgey, Starly, Pidove, Hoothoot, Joltic, Magikarp, and Cyndaquil Herbivores that drastically change diet into Carnivore instead of Omnivore. Carnivore would make more sense than herbivore for the first form of Hoothoot, Joltic, Magikarp, and Charmander. I guess technically doves eat more seeds than bugs so, the rest of the birds this is more okay for, although, wouldn't baby birds be fed more traditionally partially digested bugs not seeds as they're famous for? Feebas, Remoraid and Mantyke all move to omnivore from herbivore, but, once again, their fish species are carnivorous. Zizagoon moves from herbivore to omnivore too, and it should probably always be an omnivore given raccoon diet. Eevee's a pretty debated on being more feline or canine, but both families generally range from carnivore to omnivore with the skew toward carnivore, so omnivore makes sense on the family, but then why are Eevee, Leafeon, and Sylveon herbivores? Also, I guess lastly, Gothita seems like it's humanlike enough that it'd be an omnivore like Abra and Ralts? I'd totally believe that the answer is that the template for a pok&#195;&#169;dex entry is herbivore and you didn't wanna look it up or bother with something really trivial that has almost no mechanical value, but I am genuinely curious and I'd really appreciate feedback? I started looking into this when I found out that Espurr was an Herbivore, even though Meowth and Glameow are carnivores, and Skitty's an omnivore? That's kinda weird too I guess.

It's comparable to Sky Attack, Boomburst, and Psycho Boost if you only take one roll into account, so I feel that's more fair.", 
        "It would be page 236; the one that shows the damage process. You are only making a single attack; the attack hits more than one target, but each target is hit by the same attack. The first line of \"Dealing Damage\" specifies you apply the effects of the attack to the target, and that damage is an an effect of the attack. Thus, the damage belongs to the attack - not the individual targets.\n\nYour, for example, Heat Wave has the same power throughout; it doesn't have high points and low points. Targets may take more or less damage, but that's because of defenses and Typings, not because you forgot to attack an area as hard as the others. You also only roll Accuracy once - again, you're using only a single Move. Even Pass Moves only roll for damage and accuracy once.\n\nNothing -absolutely explicitly- states these things, since the page only talks about 1-target attacks, and that's a bit of an oversight, but if the devs had wanted AoE moves to require additional accuracy and damage rolls, they would have specified so, because that's how they roll. And with the already time-consuming amount of rolls and nature of combat, and the devs' efforts to reduce that as much as they can, we can assume they wouldn't have wanted a single Heat Wave to require 5 separate Accuracy and Damage rolls.", 
        "Ah. I'd seen that. Extrapolating the single-target information over to include area of effect attacks would be an interpretation of the rules. RAI against RAW, as it were.\nIn counterpoint, stating something has the exact same effect all throughout its area of effect is rather silly. Just look at any real-world blast effect.\nIn addition, the language being addressed at a single target actually suggests that each target of a multi-target attack is to be treated separately by the damage-dealing phase.",

        "We can disagree on whether it makes logical sense or is intended, but even if that is how you interpret it, I still personally would not recommend using that method, because combat is already prone to being bogged down by rolls, and making each target compare their Evasion against a different Accuracy roll, or their Defenses against different Damage rolls(and ensuring everyone knows which one is meant for them, trust me, that's just as much an issue) is a major hassle and slows the game down more than is necessary. Having to go back and re-do math and calculations because someone took incorrect damage is not fun, and it's already a somewhat common occurrence. When I played PTA back in the olden days, we played that way, rolling ACC and Damage individually for every target, and it caused way too much confusion and takesies-backsies for me to even consider carrying it over into my PTU games.\n\nIt's not as much about who's right or what makes sense as it is about making the game fun and streamlined, and I think propagating that mindset has been one of the devs' biggest goals when designing PTU.\n\nNow, in PbP games, it is more practical to run things that way and make sure everyone knows what rolls are going where, and you usually have more time to straighten out any remaining confusion, so if that's how you're playing, you can use that system without too many drawbacks, though it'll still require a bit more time and effort. But, in the faster-paced world of real-time games, even those played in Maptool or R20 and not IRL where you would either flood the table with a million dice or have to wait and note down each result between every roll, it's a bad idea.",
